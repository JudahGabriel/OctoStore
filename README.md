# OctoStore
OctoStore lets you publish your open source app to the Microsoft Store without leaving your GitHub repo.

You can think of this as a GitHub Actions build step that publishes an app to the Microsoft Store on Windows.

## How to publish my app to the Microsoft Store

All you need to do is include a file named `ms-store-publish.json` in your repo. For progressive web apps (PWAs), it should look like this:

```json

    "name": "EtzMitzvot",
    "iconUrl": "https://etzmitzvot.com/assets/icons/logo-512x512.png",

                "Read the underlying passages of each commandment",
                "Learn about the commandments in a visual way"
            ],
            "whatsNew": "Added commandment 75, added store publish.json"
        }
    ]
}
```

For example, see [this repo's ms-store-publish.json](https://github.com/JudahGabriel/etzmitzvot/blob/master/public/ms-store-publish.json).
